You can configure GitHub to automatically build and deploy your site every time you push a new markdown file to the `main` branch.

1. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Pages**.
2. Set the **Source** to "GitHub Actions".
3. Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file in your repository:

```yaml
name: Deploy GenTatic to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    needs: build
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
